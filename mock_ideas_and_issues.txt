Some ideas for http-mock project

Improvements:
- time-out MOCK response 
- n-errors and then correct response
- responses with dates updates to now
- external response creators (template or script?). It also can cover all above topics.

Architectural improvements:

- add web-socket connection support on the same basis as HTTP chunked connections
- optional external storage for responses like redis or some other database

Issues:
- small size data compression: 
    response received or stored with "Content-Encoding: gzip" and response data less than 512 bytes is passed to requestor with "Content-Encoding: gzip" and uncompressed data.
