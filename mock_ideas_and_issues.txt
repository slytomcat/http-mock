Some ideas for http-mock project

Improvements:
- time-out MOCK response 
- n-errors and then correct response
- responses with dates updates to now
- external response creators (template or script?). It also can cover all above topics.

Architectural improvements:

- add web-socket connection support on the same basis as HTTP chunked connections
- optional external storage for responses like redis or some other database
- compact big chunks to decrease RAM usage

Issues:
- small size data compression: 
    response received or stored with "Content-Encoding: gzip" and response data less than 512 bytes is passed to requestor with "Content-Encoding: gzip" and uncompressed data.
    fixed 27-28.01.2024.

- chunked big JSON data is broken by new lines at end of chunks.
    the http package adds chunking automatically if handlers don't set a Content-Length in header. And it automatically remove all  new lines/tabs/spaces at end of chunk.
    So on the top of http package there is no way to understand is there a new line at end of chink or not.
    The workaround solution: don't add new line at end when `Content-Type` is set to `application/json` in the response header. 
    The workaround solution implemented on 03.02.2024.
